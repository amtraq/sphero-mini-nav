# Sphero Mini Asynchronous Tracking/Control Library
[Sphero Mini](https://www.sphero.com/sphero-mini) 

Based on work from:
- MProx's Sphero Mini Library
- SpheroNAV

## Dependencies:
This library is being tested with Python 3.6.5, but should work for other 3.x versions. This library also uses the Bluepy module for BLE communication, so make sure this is installed. On Debian-based Linux:

> $ sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

> $ pip install bluepy --user
